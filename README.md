# Schoolhouse

I'm going back to school! ðŸŽ“

I've decided to actively engage in my personal learning regime, by completing
exercises in programming books, tutorials, challenges, quizzes, etc. This
repository will contain all the artifacts I produce on this journey.

I hope to revisit some of the classic texts, enjoyed oh so long ago, but
this time by putting fingers to keyboard and recording the experiences
here in the form of source-code memoirs, if you will. Of course, I am
literally vibrating with delicious anticipation of also diving into some
new programming books that teeter precariously on my stack of unreads.

Throwing hubris to the wind, I am perfectly happy to tackle even the simplest
of programming exercises. I feel strongly in the considerable dividends of
practice, practice, and more practice; I am not above writing yet another
recursive fibonacci subroutine ðŸ˜‰.
